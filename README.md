This is a modified version of [Kepano's Obsidian Template](https://github.com/kepano/kepano-obsidian/tree/main)

Personally, I structure the repository as followss:
- Attachments: contains images and other data that I wish to refer to in notes.
- Categories: contains summaries of categries (e.g. projects will list all projects).
- Daily: contains daily notes that don't belong in another note.
- Knowledge Bank: contains summaries of large bits of information (tutorials, training, etc).
- Notes: contains meeting and development notes.
- References: contains data that will be regularly referenced by other notes (people, institutions, projects).
- Templates: contains templates that will be used again and again (e.g. for meetings).

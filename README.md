# Tips and tricks

_Obsidian shortcuts_
Getting familiar with shortcuts in Obsidian can greatly speed up your workflow. One of the most convenient shortcuts to familiarise yourself with is inserting a template to a new note.

To do this, first create a new note in the relevant subdirectory of your vault. Then, press `ctrl + P` to bring up the command palette, type `template` and press enter. Now, you will be able to select what template to insert (e.g. type `meeting` and press enter).
